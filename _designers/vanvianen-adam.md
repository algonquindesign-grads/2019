bio: Every aspect of design, whether it be branding, motion graphics, UI/UX, logo design, packaging, web development, intrigues me. I like to dip my foot into every bit of it. From a young age I loved marketing and advertising, but I also had a passion for art. You put those two together and you have graphic design. Creativity is like a muscle, the more you use it, the stronger it gets. Graphic design allows me to gain a stronger creativity every day.
